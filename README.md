## Overview
This module has us learning Plotly, a JavaScript data visualization library that creates data visualizations that are attractive, interactive and most importantly very accessible as you can publish your findings on the internet for everyone to appreciate.  This takes care of the problem of having any prospective client who is interested in your findings to download, install and navigate any needed software platforms for a particular language that they many not have just to look at graphs and plots that you created.

We are assisting a micro-biologist Roza who works at a prominent laboratory discovering and documenting bacteria, in particular, she is looking for bacterial species that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef.  Her lab has partnered with IMPROBABLE BEEF, a food start-up company that is interested in possible candidate species of bacteria.  Since bacterial species can vary from person-to-person and even in the same locations on a person's body, Roza's hypothesis is her target bacteria species can be found in a particular someone's belly button.  Although this scenario is made up for this particular module, actual studies such as this have been conducted in the real world.  
National Geographic reported that 1,458 of the species "may be new to science," and some of the bacteria were entirely out of their known context. One person's belly button "harbored a bacterium that had previously been found only in soil from Japan," where he had never been. Another had two types of "extremophile bacteria that typically thrive in ice caps and thermal vents."

## Plotly Charts
Most of the Module taught us methods to create various charts from different datasets.  The charts included line, pie and vertical and horizontal bar charts.

In the Challenge portion, the aforementioned charts were welcomed with an interactive scatterplot chart as well as the addition of a very new one called a gauge chart.  This chart which was also interactive looked very similar to a speedometer as it was in the shape of a semi-arc.  These can be viewed through the attached link at the top of this ReadMe file.

## Summary
This module was very engaging as it was challenging.  The use of the console during the coding process proved useful to pinpoint certain errors, however I did have to reach out to Learning Assistants a few times to get guidance in correcting those errors.  One error in particular, the creation of an array variable for the metadata was one I actually saw but could not pinpoint enough to correct on my own.  

Learning about real studies that were conducted on bacterial species found in belly buttons was a bit shocking.  Something to think about the next time I take a shower.

The personalization of the webpage was another highlight as it was personalizing the UFO webpage from Module 11.  At first, I did not see the appeal of creating webpages.  I am starting to appreciate the creation of these webpages especially learning the ins and outs of how they work.
