## Overview
This module has us learning Plotly, a JavaScript data visualization library that creates data visualizations that are attractive, interactive and most importantly very accessible as you can publish your findings on the internet for everyone to appreciate.  This takes care of the problem of having any prospective client who is interested in your findings to download, install and navigate any needed software platforms for a particular language that they many not have just to look at graphs and plots that you created.

We are assisting a micro-biologist Roza who works at a prominent laboratory discovering and documenting bacteria, in particular, she is looking for bacterial species that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef.  Her lab has partnered with IMPROBABLE BEEF, a food start-up company that is interested in possible candidate species of bacteria.  Since bacterial species can vary from person-to-person and even in the same locations on a person's body, Roza's hypothesis is her target bacteria species can be found in a particular someone's belly button.  Although this scenario is made up for this particular module, actual studies such as this have been conducted in the real world.  
National Geographic reported that 1,458 of the species "may be new to science," and some of the bacteria were entirely out of their known context. One person's belly button "harbored a bacterium that had previously been found only in soil from Japan," where he had never been. Another had two types of "extremophile bacteria that typically thrive in ice caps and thermal vents.
